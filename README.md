# ipfs-static-website
My first experiment with IPFS to host a static website. In this project I will upload a simple static website to IPFS and see how I would get it working with either DNS or ENS according to the instructions from https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/host-single-page-site/#create-your-site.
